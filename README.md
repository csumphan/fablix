The script used to parse the time measurement logs is script.py. The script is used to parse the time measurement found in the log file. Each line in the log consist of two numbers split by a ";". The script will split the line into two parts using the ";" as the delimiter. The first number is the TS and the second number is TJ. The TS is then appended to the TS_list and the TJ is then appended to the TJ_list. After the entire files has been read through, the script will calculate the average value of both lists and prints the result to the console.
